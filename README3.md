# Employee Data Analysis Project - Coach to Coder Task 3

Welcome to my Employee Data Analysis project repository! In this project, I delve into company data to perform various tasks related to employee information, salaries, and analysis. I've utilized Python programming to extract insights and solve the challenges presented.

## Project Overview

As part of this project, I tackle a series of tasks that involve processing employee data. The tasks include:
