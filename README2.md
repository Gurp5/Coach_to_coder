River Information Project - Coach to Coder Task 2
Welcome to my coding journey as part of the Coach to Coder program by Bright Network! This project is a showcase of my progress in enhancing my Python skills over the course of four weeks. Python's versatility has always fascinated me, and I'm excited to present my accomplishments through this river information project.

About the Project
In this repository, I'm proud to share a project that showcases my independent coding skills. This task, undertaken as part of the Coach to Coder program, involved processing river data. The primary goal was to extract valuable information from a list of rivers, and I took it a step further by adding extensions to enhance the functionality.

Project Highlights
Language: Python
Duration: Completed in a focused session
Project Goals
Print out each river's name in a loop.
Calculate and print the total length of all rivers combined.
Print the names of rivers that begin with the letter "M".
Display river lengths in kilometers, converted from miles.
Key Learnings
Throughout this project, I gained insights into:

Iteration and loop structures in Python
Manipulating dictionaries and lists
Conditional statements for data filtering
Conversion of units (miles to kilometers)
Collaborative Experience
This journey has been made enriching by the collaborative atmosphere of the Coach to Coder community. Sharing ideas, discussing challenges, and building connections with fellow participants have all contributed to my growth as a coder.

Future Explorations
This project marks a stepping stone in my coding adventure. I'm enthusiastic about tackling more intricate projects, exploring diverse Python capabilities, and refining my programming skills further. Stay tuned for more exciting coding endeavors!

I invite you to explore my river information project and provide valuable feedback. Your insights will play a crucial role in my ongoing development as a proficient coder.

Thank you for taking the time to delve into my project, and happy coding! :)
