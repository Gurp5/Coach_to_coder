# Week 4 Task

# Base task: Using the csv package, read in the data from the vw.csv file, and turn
# them into a list of dicts or a list of namedtuples, similar to how we did things for the Amazon
# bestseller list during the lesson. Answer the following questions:

# 1. What is the most expensive VW car listed?
# 2. Find all the VW Golf models. What is their average price?
# 3. What is the average milage for VW Polo models registered in 2020?
# Extension: Using pandas and matplotlib , create the following:
# 1. A pie chart showing the distribution between fuel types. (You can use the model column
# to count occurances!)
# 2. A bar chart showing the average mileage for each model. (You need to research how
# can you calculate average using pandas!)

        most_expensive_car = car

# Question 2: Find all the VW Golf models. What is their average price?

# for car in cars:
#     if(car.model == "Golf" and car.year == 2020):
#         no_golf_models1 += 1
#         car_total_values1 += float(car.mileage)
# print(no_golf_models1)

# Extension: Using pandas and matplotlib , create the following:
# 1. A pie chart showing the distribution between fuel types. (You can use the model column to count occurances!)
# 2. A bar chart showing the average mileage for each model. (You need to research hpow can you calculate average using pandas!)

# Ex - Question 1
