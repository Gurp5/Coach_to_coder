River Information Project - Coach to Coder Task 2

Welcome to my Coach to Coder journey presented by the Bright Network team! I'm thrilled to share my progress in this 4-week coding program where I'm refining my Python programming skills. As someone who's captivated by Python's potential, I find its versatility and excitement unmatched.

**About the Project**
This repository signifies a significant milestone as it showcases my first independent project outside of a university setting. As part of this project, I undertook the task of creating a river information program. The primary goal was to process river data, extracting essential details from a list of rivers. I also embraced optional challenges, expanding the functionality to enhance the project further.

**Project Highlights**
Language: Python
Duration: Completed within a dedicated session
Project Goals
Implement a loop to print each river's name.
Calculate and display the total length of all rivers.
Print the names of rivers starting with the letter "M."
Present river lengths in kilometers, converted from miles.
Key Learnings
Throughout this project, I deepened my understanding of:

**Python syntax and logical structures**
Handling user inputs and ensuring their validity
Employing conditional statements for control flow
Embracing collaborative coding within the Coach to Coder community
Collaborative Experience
One of the most rewarding aspects of this journey has been engaging with fellow Coach to Coder participants. We shared insights, overcame challenges, and fostered meaningful connections, enriching my coding experience.

**Future Endeavors**
This project serves as a stepping stone in my coding odyssey. I'm excited to tackle more intricate projects, explore the intricacies of Python's capabilities, and refine my skills. Expect more exhilarating coding escapades in the near future!

I invite you to explore my river information project. Your thoughts, recommendations, and perspectives are invaluable as I strive to evolve as a proficient developer.

Thank you for taking a moment to delve into my project. Happy coding! :)
