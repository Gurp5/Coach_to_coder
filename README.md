ATM Simulation Project - Coach to Coder Task 1

Welcome to my Coach to Coder journey presented by the Bright Network team! I'm excited to share with you my progress in this 4-week coding program where I'm honing my Python programming skills. As someone who's always been intrigued by the power of Python, I find this language to be incredibly versatile and exciting to work with.

About the Project
This repository marks an important milestone for me as it represents my very first independent project outside of a university setting. As part of this project, I was tasked with creating an ATM simulation â€“ a digital cash machine! The primary objective was to implement a user authentication mechanism using PIN numbers and provide access to account balances. Additionally, I decided to take on the optional challenge, extending the functionality to include withdrawal and deposit facilities.

Project Highlights
Language: Python
Duration: Completed within a focused hour
Project Goals
Implement user authentication using PIN numbers
Display account balance upon successful authentication
Extend functionality to enable withdrawals and deposits

Key Learnings
Throughout this project, I had the opportunity to reinforce my understanding of:

Basic Python syntax and logic
User input handling and validation
Conditional statements and flow control
Collaborative coding through the Coach to Coder community
Collaborative Experience
One of the most rewarding aspects of this journey has been collaborating with fellow attendees of the Coach to Coder program. Sharing ideas, troubleshooting challenges, and making valuable connections have all contributed to enhancing my learning experience.

Future Prospects
This project marks just the beginning of my coding journey. I'm eager to explore more complex projects, delve deeper into Python's capabilities, and continue refining my skills. Stay tuned for more exciting coding adventures!

I invite you to take a closer look at my project. Your feedback, suggestions, and insights are all greatly appreciated as I strive to grow as a developer.

Thank you for visiting and happy coding! :)
